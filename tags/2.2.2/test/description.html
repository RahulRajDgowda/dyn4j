The <a href="http://www.dyn4j.org/">dyn4j</a> project is a 100% Java collision detection 
and physics engine for use in games. Designed to be fast, stable, and extensible taking 
much from a C++ project called Box2d.
</p>
<p>
This application is used for testing all portions of the dyn4j project.
</p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The dyn4j project started as a pet project for game development and quickly grew into a fully 
functional physics engine. The main focus during development was learning techniques used 
to solve collision detection and physical modeling problems. As a result, the project 
contains significant documentation and is heavily commented.
</p>
<p>
Currently the project only supports 2D. The project supports both Convex and non-Convex 
shapes (through composition) and features two collision detection algorithm implementations: 
SAT and GJK. The dynamics solver is Box2d's Sequential Impulse (SI) solver.  The project is
released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD License</a>.
</p>
<p>
This library has no dependencies but does require Java 1.6+. To run or compile the JUnit tests 
in the test directory will require JUnit 4 or greater. To run or compile this TestBed application, 
another jar in the lib directory is provided.  You can download binaries or check out the source 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dyn4j/">here</a>.
