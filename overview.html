	A 100% Java collision detection and physics engine for use in games. Designed to be fast, stable, and extensible taking much from a C++ project called Box2d. I would like to emphasize that this project is not a port of Box2d, however it does use concepts and in some ways look and function in a similar way.
	<br /><br />
	The project started as a pet project for game development and quickly grew into a fully functional physics engine. The main focus during development was learning techniques used to solve collision detection and physical modeling problems. As a result, the project contains significant documentation and is heavily commented.
	<br /><br />
	The intention of releasing this project to open source is to allow other developers solving the same problems to have a clear and understandable reference.
	<br /><br />
	Currently the project only supports 2D but has plans for 3D support in the future. The project supports both Convex and non-Convex shapes (through composition) and features two collision detection algorithm implementations: SAT and GJK. The dynamics solver is Box2d's Sequential Impulse (SI) solver.
	<br /><br />
	This library has no dependencies. To run or compile the JUnit tests in the test directory will require JUnit 4 or greater. To run or compile the TestBed?, another jar in the lib directory is provided. You can find the latest version of that jar at <a href="http://www.codezealot.org/projects/game/">http://www.codezealot.org/projects/game/</a>.
